    <h3> blog post one</h3>

    <p>Hi friends. Today I deployed my first website! This site consists of 3 simple pages of HTML-- the building blocks of the web. The HTML was written on sublime text for mac. As of now there is only a basic call function to collect email addresses for a mailing list and it was all implemented without the need of CSS, PHP, JS, or any backend code. I am able to log addresses by connecting my form to formsubmit and being able to point the action-attribute t their forms endpoints and have them email me the submissions back. The bulk HTML work and website deployed in around 4 hours. Next is CSS and JS to add more aesthetics and working functions. Thx for reading -Tony </p>

    <p>Today I added a custom domain as well as a free hit counter to the website. I look forward to messing around with CSS and get the aesthetics of the website looking a bit better. More to come soon!</p>

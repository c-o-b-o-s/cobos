    <h3> blog post one</h3>
    <small> posted by tony on 3/7/22</small>
    <p>Today I deployed my first hand built website and you are on it! This modest site consists of 3 simple pages of HTML-- the building blocks of the web. The HTML was written on sublime text for mac. As of now there is only a basic call function to collect email addresses for a mailing list and it was all implemented without the need of CSS, PHP, JS, or any backend code. I am able to log addresses by connecting my form to formsubmit and being able to point the action-attribute t their forms endpoints and have them email me the submissions back. The bulk HTML work and website deployed in around 4 hours. Next is CSS and JS to add more aesthetics and working functions. Thx for reading -Tony </p>

    <p>Ok I've been messing around with CSS for a few hours and this shit is nuts lol... pretty fun but definitely a lot of work. Aesthetics should look a bit better and made some things a bit reactive.. pretty neat. Still need to work on CSS and then start playing around with JS to get the site more functional but it's been cool so far.</p>
